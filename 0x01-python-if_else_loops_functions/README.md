# Requirements
Python Scripts
-----------
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 
14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory

Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

Shell Scripts
--------
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash

All your files must be executable

# C Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic

All your files should end with a new line

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

All your header files should be include guarded
