![alt text](https://github.com/facu2279/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping/sqlpythonimage.jpg)
General
-----------
- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table


Requirements
------------
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- Your files will be executed with MySQLdb version 1.3.x
- Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.2.x
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- You are not allowed to use execute with sqlalchemy

Task Description
---------
### Task 0
List all the states of the hbtn_0e_0_usa database

### Task 1
lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from database

### Task 2
Takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table where name matches the argument.

### Task 3
Takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument but that is safe because from MySQL injections!

### Task 4
Lists all cities from the database

### Task 5
Takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using database

### Task 6
Python file that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base()

### Task 7
Lists all State objects from database

### Task 8
Prints the first State object from database

### Task 9
Lists all State objects that contain the letter a from database

### Task 10
Prints the State object with the name passed as argument from database

### Task 11
Adds the State object “Louisiana” to database

### Task 12
Changes the name of a State object from database 

### Task 13
Deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from database

### Task 14
Python file similar to model_state.py named model_city.py that contains the class definition of a City

### Task 15
Improve the files model_city.py and model_state.py, and save them as relationship_city.py and relationship_state.py

### Task 16
Lists all State objects, and corresponding City objects

### Task 17
Lists all City objects from the database
